#### ExileLife Mod: An ArmA 3 Exile modification
20 years have passed since the start of the EXILE. A handful of the original inmates are still alive and, using their knowledge of the island, these inmates have seized control of key towns across the island - forming four gangs: the Cartel, the Mafia, the Syndicate, and the Yakuza.

NATO leaders had long since forgotten the prisoners, but with the renewed violence it once again drew their attention. Their war with CSAT was rapidly draining all available resources and they saw an opportunity and seized it. Quickly and quietly, they moved a private security force to the island. These guards' mission: to control the island and start exporting the island's rich resources using the inmates as labour.

You are a fresh inmate, processed by the courts and shipped straight to EXILE. You have a choice: live a life of solitude under the radar, or pledge your life to a gang. Running away from the protection of the gangs may seem the more lucrative option. But be warned, the guards can only patrol so much of the island, and putting one step in the wrong territory could end your life.

The life of a gang member, on the other hand, requires strength, perseverance, and loyalty. Your gang is your family, shelter, job, and above all else, your protection. Prove your worth to your gang and you will find your place in its hierarchy. However, even in families, power comes at a cost and you may find that the only way to raise yourself above the rest is to remove them by force. Just remember that loyalty is rewarded, but a poorly-planned betrayal will lead to a punishment worse than death.
